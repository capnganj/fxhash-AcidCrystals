# fxhash-AcidCrystals
Reflective, randomly generated LSD-25 crystals 

Uses the fxhash webpack boilerplate as a base, and uses threejs, d3js, and some awesome rockin cc0 equirectangular environment photos from polhhaven.
Check out [HashSmoke](https://github.com/capnganj/fxhash-HashSmoke) and [MobiusBlocks](https://github.com/capnganj/fxhash-MobiusBlocks) for webpack documentation and threejs learening process.

Smoke weed every day.  Don't take too much LSD IRL.  One love, @capnganj
